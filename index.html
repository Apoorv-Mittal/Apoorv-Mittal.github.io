						<p class="change">.. an undergraduate from the University of Maryland-College Park.
							<br>He is currently pursuing a degree in Computer science and expect to graduate in the year 2020.<br>
							But really he is still a kid in front of my parents.<br>
							His sister says that he is crazy.<br>
							His schoolmates who say he is a very straight forward person.<br>
							There are strangers who stereotype him as a very serious person and are surprised once they get to know him. <br>
							<br>
							But to tell you the truth, he does not know himself.<br>
							As far as he knows, he is a simple, kind, fun loving guy who can be crazy sometimes.<br>
							He likes to stay busy.<br>
							He work hard for what he has passion for.<br>
							He can excel if given the opportunity.<br>
							He is not sure if he has achieved something in life or not but one thing is true-He will become better compared to what he was yesterday and keep on improving himself day by day!<br>
							<br>
							<p style="font-size:60px" class="change">And this is Apoorv.</p>
