				<!-- i wrote this on january 6,2017 at 6:32pm when i felt miserable. When i had no one around me or in my life to talk to. Being alone in US is really hard or me but i want to succeed in my dream of settling in the US. -->
				<p   style="float: left;">
					<p class="change">.. an undergraduate from the University of Maryland-College Park.
					<br>He is currently pursuing a degree in Computer science and expect to graduate in the year 2020.<br>
					But really he is still a kid in front of my parents.<br>
					His sister says that he is crazy.<br>
					His schoolmates say that he is a very straight forward person.<br>
					There are strangers who stereotype him as a very serious person and are surprised once they get to know him. <br>
					<br>
					But to tell you the truth, he does not know himself.<br>
					As far as he knows, he is a simple, kind, fun loving guy who can be crazy sometimes.<br>
					He likes to stay busy.<br>
					He work hard for what he has passion for.<br>
					He can excel if given the opportunity.<br>
					He is not sure if he has achieved something in life or not but one thing is true-He will become better compared to what he was yesterday and keep on improving himself day by day!<br>
					<br>
					<p style="font-size:60px" class="change">And this is Apoorv.</p>
