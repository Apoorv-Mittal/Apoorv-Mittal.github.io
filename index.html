					<!-- i wrote this on january 6,2017 at 6:32pm when i felt miserable. When i had no one around me or in my life to talk to. Being alone in US is really hard or me but i want to succeed in my dream of settling in the US. -->
					<p   style="float: left;">
						<p class="change">I am an undergraduate from the University of Maryland-College Park.
							<br>I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer science and expect to graduate in the year 2020.<br>
							But really I am still a kid in front of my parents.<br>
							My sister says that I am crazy.<br>
							I have schoolmates who say I am a very straight forward person.<br>
							There are strangers who stereotype me as a very serious person and are surprised once they get to know me. <br>
							<br>
							But to tell you the truth, I don't know much about me.<br>
							As far as I know, I am a simple, kind, fun loving guy who can be crazy sometimes.<br>
							I like to stay busy.<br>
							I prefer to do things my way.  <br>
							I work hard for what I have passion for.<br>
							I can excel if I am given the opportunity.<br>
							I am not sure if I have achieved something in life or not but one thing is true-I will become better compared to what I was yesterday and keep on improving myself day by day!<br>
							<br>
							<p style="font-size:60px">And this is who I am.</p>
